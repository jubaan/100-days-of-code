# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Daily Log

### Day 0: January 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Start #100DaysOfCode challenge.

**Thoughts:** Right now I'm working the Ruby section of the technical curriculum of Microverse, feeling a little stuck with ruby... For context, this is my second month learning how to code. I started my carrer as a ****Web Developer Fullstack**** on November 25, 2019. Just finish the HTML & CSS3 section and as I said right now I'm in the Ruby part. Started this challenge with this goals in mind:

- Practice Ruby
- Make coding a daily habit
- Be a better programmer

This statements are going to change over the 100 days. Right now I just want to get better at Ruby. I'm working with the curriculum at Microverse and the Ruby track at exercism.io... by the way have you had the opportunity to talk to VGoff

### Day 1: January 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I've been approved two exercises from exercism.io

**Thoughts:** Lovin exercism.io and the feedback of my mentor [@kotp](https://twitter.com/kotp). Ruby is still hard to understand for me, but I think also is getting easier to read the documentation and understand what the code examples suppose to do. My technical skill on ruby are still poor but I'm commited to do at least 1hr a day of coding exercises and continue studying the Microverse Ruby section (...at least 8 hrs daily).

### Day 2: January 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Advanced on the third exercise of the ruby track on exercisim.io

**Thoughts:** Didn't do much coding today, just a small exercise. Also this past week I worked on the ["enumerable methods"](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/advanced-building-blocks) of The Odin Project... I haven't quite understand how each method works. I'm using both calls to procs and yield but havent really figured out how to make **my_method** be an exact clone of the Ruby methods.

### Day 3: January 27, 2020

**Thoughts:** Advanced on the [corrections](https://github.com/jubaan/m__advanced-building-blocks__enumerable-methods/pull/1) of The Odin Project. [More Info](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/advanced-building-blocks)

### Day 4: January 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finish with my second draft of the enumerable projects

**Thoughts:** Second draft ready of the Enumerable Methods [corrections](https://github.com/jubaan/m__advanced-building-blocks__enumerable-methods/pull/1) of The Odin Project. [More Info](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/advanced-building-blocks).

Not about coding, but I noticed today that my fast log on twitter started from day 1 and my log on github on day 0, so it kind of looks I have one day missing... but I'm up to

### Day 5: January 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Got approved my "Enumerable Methods" project

**Thoughts:** Project approved [corrections](https://github.com/jubaan/m__advanced-building-blocks__enumerable-methods/pull/1) of The Odin Project. [More Info](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/advanced-building-blocks). I also did some exercism.io exercises but haven been reviewed so I cannot advanced on them.

I helped 3 persons today with their own projects, and this is making me feel useful, also is giving me the oportunity to refresh my knowledge in HTML & CSS.
